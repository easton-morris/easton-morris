# About Me

Hi! My name is Easton Morris. I'm a Web Developer based out of Southern California. I mainly work with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS using React.js.
However, I am learning the SharePoint Framework and Python. (I do keep a little C in my back pocket for my keyboards.)

Fun fact: I have a :mortar_board: degree in Linguistics and love learning human languages as much as computer languages! 초등학생처럼 말할수 있는데 더 배울 것입니다.:bow:

My passions are in :video_game:Gaming, :basketball:Sports, :calling:Communications and the tech that supports them! I am learning more everyday and look
forward to growing my skills and contributing meaningfully in any way possible.

I also have a beautiful little pup, Mercy! She wishes you a good day. :angel:
